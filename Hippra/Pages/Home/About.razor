                        Without the process of collaboration, humankind would never have evolved to harness the ingenuity, innovation and creativity that has produced some of the world’s most important milestones. At Nexus 8 International, we are poised to facilitate the collaborative process by providing the Hippra application and web-based platform for healthcare providers. This technology will allow physicians to access the infinite intelligence that exists when individuals come together to do meaningful problem solving and to promote positive results when it comes to dealing with difficult to treat medical cases.

                        When critical infectious diseases and public health crises occur, like COVID-19, the lack of expedient, efficient global collaboration and a viable alert system among healthcare providers significantly impacts the ability to save lives. Medical professionals face challenging problems every day without having a way to easily connect with colleagues and other care  givers to find the optimal solution for their patients.
